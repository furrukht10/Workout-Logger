# Workout-Logger

This application allows you to log your workouts on a map. The application uses the Geolocation API, localStorage API, and
the leaflet library to accurately pinpoint your location on a map and store data. This application was designed primarily using object-oriented 
programming and concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance,
encapsulation, arrays, and methods. 

This application was designed under the supervision of Jonas Schmedtmann and his JavaScript course. The application will constantly
be improved in the future independently.
